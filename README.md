### ðŸŽ’ O'clock courses

I'm currently following a software arhitecture course with a block release training.

### ðŸ’» Work 

Alongside, I work for [Carbone 4](https://www.carbone4.com/en), on their financial platform.

### ðŸ¤“ Side projects

Learning to code I practice on several small side projects as [The Bellemartisseur](https://www.carbone4.com/en), [The Scrabblculator](https://github.com/Justine-Gouaux/Le-Scrabblculator) or Frontend Mentor challenges as [profil card component](https://github.com/Justine-Gouaux/Profil-card-component) and [pricing component with toggle](https://github.com/Justine-Gouaux/Pricing-component-with-toggle).

Now I have a bigger one: a collaborative platform for chefs involved in sustainable food projects to get in touch, exchange good practices and provide shared equipments.
